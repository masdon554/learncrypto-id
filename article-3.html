                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Cryptocurrency is a form of digital finance that can be used to purchase goods and services, but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions . The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has had very impressive price movements in 2021. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the goods or services the company provides. Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.</p>

                     <div class="text-justify">
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Everyone asks this most often. From what is currently known, there are many types of crypto coins that have been distributed throughout the world. Of all the coins that exist, initially following the process from the beginning of all coins, namely Bitcoin. So let's briefly explain how this is actually processed. This time we will discuss what happens to a Bitcoin transaction from sending to receiving. So basically this process will carry out 3 big steps along with many processes in it. The 3 parts are Signing, Broadcasting and Confirming.</p>
                         <ol class="container">
                             <div class="form-group">
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold lead">Sign</span></li>
                                 <p class="lead">When you want to send bitcoin funds to someone, what you do is send them via Wallet, and start sending them. The wallet will respond to the request and create a transaction message containing information about the Sender, Recipient and Amount sent.</p>
                                 <p class="lead">Next the wallet will create a unique digital signature on this message with meMix it mathematically with your Private Key. Basically a "Private Key" is a long string of letters and numbers that acts as a "Password" for your wallet account. Anyone who has your “Private Key”, can control your Bitcoin Wallet. A digital signature is a way of proving that you have a "Private Key".</p>
                                 <dl class="row lead">
                                     <dt class="col-sm-2">Note :</dt>
                                     <dd class="col-sm-10">Each transaction carried out has a different signature.</dd>
                                 </dl>
                                 <p>After signing a transaction message, Wallet will group the digital signature together with the transaction message which produces a transaction file in the form of a Hash code. In this process the first step of signing has been completed.</p>
                                 <dl class="row lead">
                                     <dt class="col-sm-2">Note :</dt>
                                     <dd class="col-sm-10">A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input value of any size into an output (hash) of a fixed size. In most cases, the output consists of hexadecimal numbers. This means hashes are often represented as a combination of numbers (0 to 9) and letters (a to f).</dd>
                                 </dl>
                             </div>
                             <div class="form-group">
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold lead">Broadcasting</span></li>
                                 <p class="lead">In this step, the transaction file that has been created will be sent by the wallet to other computers that store copies of the Blockchain. These computers are called Nodes.</p>
                                 <p class="lead">Each Node verifies that it is legitimate. This is basically looking to see that you actually have the funds to spend. Once your file is verified it is then forwarded to another Node on the network which repeats this process. When the Node receives files, they will all be saved into a Holding area called Mempool.</p>
                                 <dl class="row lead">
                                     <dt class="col-sm-2">Note :</dt>
                                     <dd class="col-sm-10">Mempool is short for "Memory Pool", which is space dedicated to valid but unconfirmed transactions.</dd>
                                 </dl>
                                 <p class="lead">Once the transaction message finds its way into the Mempool of the various Online Nodes in the Network, we can say that the second step of broadcasting is officially complete.</p>
                                 <dl class="row lead">
                                     <dt class="col-sm-2">Note :</dt>
                                     <dd class="col-sm-10">Transaction status can be viewed online on a website called Block Explorer.</dd>
                                 </dl>
                                 <p class="lead">By using Block Explore you can actually see what is happening with your transactions as they travel along the Bitcoin network. It lets you search and navigate through the Blockchain. Using this you can also check Bitcoin balances from different Addresses, track transactions and get various statistics about the network.</p>
                                 <div class="text-center">
                                     <img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://i.imgur.com/laWkSdv.png" alt="Unconfirmed Transaction">

                                 </div>
                                 <br>
                                 <p class="lead">Well, at this point if you search for the transaction via Block Explorer, we will see that it is marked as "Unconfirmed Transaction", meaning that this transaction has been broadcast into the network and its digital signature has been verified but still not from Blockchain. This means that transactions can still be reversed and there is no guarantee that they will enter the Blockchain. If your business sells or ships goods and you accept payment in Bitcoin, you should not accept unconfirmed transactions.</p>

                             </div>
                             <div class="form-group">
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold lead">Confirming</span></li>
                                 <p class="lead">Now we can move on to the final step, confirmtransaction. If you've ever heard of Miner, Miners group transactions together, meaning they take the files in the Mempool, group them together and create a block of transactions. There is a limit to how many transactions can be included in each block. Therefore miners usually choose transactions that have the highest mining costs first.</p>
                                 <p class="lead">Miners will then compete with each other to get their blocks onto the Blockchain. The competition is based on mathematical calculations, and the miner with the most computing power will have the best chance of winning. Once a miner wins the competition and inserts his block into the Blockchain, all transactions contained in that Block will be considered as confirmed. Essentially, miners are writing the history book of Bitcoin transactions, and whoever wins the competition will write the next page.</p>
                                 <dl class="row lead">
                                     <dt class="col-sm-2">Note :</dt>
                                     <dd class="col-sm-10">On average, a new block of transactions will be mined, or entered into the Blockchain every 10 minutes. Keep in mind that this is an average, sometimes you will get 2 blocks confirmed in 1 minute, and sometimes it can take over 1 Hour.</dd>
                                 </dl>
                                 <p class="lead">If a block is mined with your transaction in it, you will see it now and it will be displayed in the block explorer as having 1 confirmation. As more blocks will be mined, the number of confirmations will increase. Each additional Block is installed on top of our own block and that makes it harder to remove. That's why it's usually recommended to wait at least 6 blocks, before considering no possibility of cancellation. That's it, your transaction is now fully confirmed and accepted.</p>

                             </div>
                         </ol>

                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">From the reading above you can understand how this can be called the safest system technology at the moment, this is what makes crypto coins get many fans to join them. In the future, we still don't know what the future of Crypto Currency will be like. No one knows except the developers.</p>
