                    Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. But actually the theory about cryptocurrencies has existed since less than half a century ago and that is where the beginning of Cryptocurrencies was created.
                     Cryptocurrency is not an object that has a physical form (like paper money) and does not have a central authority. Cryptocurrency is binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange where records of individual coin ownership are stored in ledgers that exist in the form of computerized databases that use strong cryptography to create secure transactions, control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership.

                            The concept of electronic cash (e-cash), or digital currency, is not new. Since the 1980s, e-cash protocols have existed that are based on the model proposed by
                            <a href="#" class="text-dark font-weight-bold" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#david-chaum">David Chaum</a>.
                            Just as understanding the concept of distributed systems is necessary to understand blockchain technology, the idea of e-cash is also important to appreciate the first, and very successful, applications of blockchain, Bitcoin and other Altcoins.

                        <span class="font-weight-bold">There are two fundamental problems in the e-cash system that need to be addressed as follows:</span>
                        <ul class="container lead text-justify">
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Accountability</span> is necessary to ensure that cash can only be spent once (overcoming the double-spending problem) and that it can only be used by its rightful owner. The double spending problem arises when the same money can be spent twice. Since it is very easy to make copies of digital data, this is a big problem in digital currencies because you can make many copies with the same amount of digital money.</li><br>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Anonymity</span> is necessary to protect user privacy. With physical cash, it is nearly impossible to trace spending back to the individual who actually paid the money, which provides sufficient privacy if consumers choose to hide their identity. in the digital world, however, providing such a level of privacy is difficult due to the inherent personalization, tracking, and logging mechanisms in digital payment systems such as credit card payments. This is necessary to ensure the safety and security of financial networks, but is also often considered a violation of privacy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">This is due to the fact that end users do not have any control over who their data can be shared with, even without their consent. However, this is a solvable problem and cryptography is used to overcome the problem. Especially in blockchain networks, the privacy and anonymity of participants in the blockchain is a sought after feature. David Chaum solved both of these problems during his work in the 1980s by using two cryptographic operations, namely, <a href="#" class="text-dark font-weight-bold" data-toggle="modal" data-target ="#blindsign">Blind Signature</a> and Secret Sharing. For now, suffice it to say that Blind Signature makes it possible to sign a document without actually seeing it, and secret sharing is a concept that allows the detection of double spending, i.e. using the same e-cash token twice.</p >

DigiCash requires a device software for users to pull notes from the bank and assign encrypted keys before they can be sent to recipients. This allows electronic payments to be untraceable and untraceable by the issuing bank, government or third parties. At the time DigiCash was launched, Mercantile Bank was the only United States bank to support the DigiCash system and <a href="#" class="text-dark font-weight-bold" data-toggle="modal" data-target=" #german">Deutsche Bank</a> in Germany is the second bank to support the DigiCash system.

                                <ul class="container">
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Electronic Transactions</span>, DigiCash was the first serious attempt to create a viable electronic payment system.</li>
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Anonymous Payments</span>, New cryptographic protocols mean transactions can be sent without users having to divulge any personal information.</li>
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Security</span>, Chaum's cryptographic tools such as private keys (<span class="font-italic">private keys</span>), also mean that traders can store values secretly in the system.</li>
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">The First Cryptocurrency</span>, DigiCash allows users to send and receive Cyberbucks. A digital currency that is not directly controlled by a centralized institution or bank.</li>

                                    <br>
                                <p class="lead text-justify font-weight-bold">How does DigiCash work?</p>
                                <ul class="container">
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Getting Cyberbucks</span>, DigiCash users first need to withdraw money from their bank account, which will then be converted into Cyberbucks. This will then be saved on the user's PC hard drive.</li>
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">DigiCash Transactions</span>, Users can use DigiCash to pay for goods and services. A payment request will be sent, which once approved, will allow Cyberbucks to be sent over the network to the merchant. Recipients can also automatically convert Cyberbucks into USD dollars that can be deposited directly into their bank account.</li>
                                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Blind Signatures</span>, DigiCash transactions can be private. While there are ways for banks to track coins created, users can make transactions in special digital "envelopes." It's a way the bank can ensure the transaction is valid, without the sender having to actually divulge personal information.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p class="lead text-justify" style="text-indent: 30px;">The next story is told by Raymond Stofberg who was responsible for DigiCash's financial affairs until August 1996 before DigiCash went bankrupt. Stofberg reached an agreement with Henderson Investment Management. They will invest two tranches totaling $10 million. When Chaum saw the agreement, he immediately faxed it to all the other venture capitalists with whom he was negotiating. Because news leaked to Henderson, the agreement was cancelled. A little later ING Investment Management wanted to do a deal around twenty million guilders."The day we were ready to sign, David didn't want to," says Stofberg.</p>

                            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Chaum was previously contacted by <a href="#" class="text-dark font-weight-bold" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#bill -gates">Bill Gates</a> from <a href="#" class="text-dark font-weight-bold" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#microsoft">Microsoft</a >. He wanted to integrate cash in every copy of Windows 95. Rumor has it, they were offering something like 100 million dollars. David Chaum refused to sell it. Chaum also terminated a deal with another American company, Netscape, in the same way.</p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In March 1996, David Chaum had to leave the company due to disagreements between him and employees. He appointed two people, namely Jelte van der Hoek and Wouter Habraken as new directors, then he returned to the US a year later. Soon, the rebels quarreled and most left the company. DigiCash declared bankruptcy in 1998 and later sold its assets including e-cash patents to another digital currency company, eCash Technologies.</p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In 2000, another company using the domain ecash.com and eCash Technologies sued, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. However, the court held that "just because registration of a domain name does not confer trademark rights, let alone "clearly established" rights, ECash Technologies had no obligation to disclose the registration of the domain name "ecash.com", but eCash Technologies later went bankrupt and the domain "ecash. com" remains owned by its original owner.</p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In 2002 eCash Technologies was acquired by InfoSpace, currently known as Blucora. As of 2015, the term eCash is used for digital money that can be stored on electronically sensitive cards including online or alternative payment portals and mobile applications.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">E-gold Ltd. is a successful profit service that offers transferable gold denomination accounts. It works in tandem with sister service Gold and Silver Reserve Inc., hereafter G&SR, also known as OmniPay, which sells e-gold units to members of the public in exchange for official money, and buys the units back. Both companies were launched in 1996 by Dr. Douglas Jackson, a Florida oncologist. E-gold also offers silver, platinum, and palladium accounts, but gold accounts ultimately hold 97 percent of the total E-gold account balance based on market value. Jackson said that E-gold was designed specifically for Internet transactions from the start. E-gold holds its account balances in grams of pure gold, and backs them 100 percent with gold bullion held in London. At that time, Brian Grow et al. explained the description of the E-gold model in BusinessWeek in 2006 as follows:

                                <li>E-gold can be sent between E-gold account users</li>

                            But Jackson disputed suggestions that the system was anonymous or that G&SR had no identity controls on E-gold users, although he agreed that such controls were not good enough to block criminal abuse of the system. In his congressional testimony, Jackson explained the benefits of using E-gold, as follows:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul class="container">
                                <li>Ease and low costs for sending money and payments</li>
                                 <li>Finality/non-reversibility (cannot be changed)</li>
                                 <li>A store of value free from political risk</li>
                                 <li>Enables people from any region or economic background to operate globally</li>
                                 <li>Access to credit card or bank account</li>
                                 <li>E-gold itself is free from chargeback risk</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">E-gold customers began to grow faster in 2000 and 2001. This was due to competition between companies that were both based on "digital gold currency" payments and provided in-house transfers, such as e-Dinar(2000), e-Bullion (2001), GoldMoney.com(2001) and 3P Pay(2001). Later Douglas Jackson told BusinessWeek that “E-gold has approximately 1.2 million accounts funded through $1.5 billion worth of transactions conducted in 2005” and also said at a congressional hearing “Since its inception, E-Gold has completed more than 67 million individual transactions and currently processes 50,000–70,000 account-to-account transfers per day, worth over $2 billion per year”.</p>
                            <blockquote class="container blockquote">
                                <p class="mb-0">“<span style="font-style: italic;">At E-Gold's peak, the currency will be backed by 3.8 metric tons of gold, worth more than $85 million. E-Gold is now second only to PayPal in the online payments industry.</span>”</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">But E-gold's growth ended in December 2005, when FBI and Secret Service agents raided three locations in Florida: G&SR's offices (E-gold Ltd. itself was registered in the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis), Jackson's home, and the company's computer servers in Orlando. The FBI discovered credit card network fraudsters were using E-gold accounts to send illicit funds. The justice department then targeted E-gold with the aim of forcing the service to comply with [post-9/11] regulations governing money transfer services. Federal regulations require such businesses to register their business with FinCEN to be licensed in states that require it, diligently authenticate customer identities and file suspicious activity reports on customers who appear shady. But E-Gold doesn't do this. Jackson believes E-gold is exempt from regulation because it is a payment system not a money transfer. He also voluntarily and actively cooperated with federal authorities to provide information about suspicious account activity.</p>
                            <p class="font-weight-bold">However, the Department of Justice still indicted Douglas Jackson (along with Reid A. Jackson and Barry K. Downey, identified as co-owners of E-gold) in April 2007 on four counts.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Arguments that neither E-gold nor G&SR fit the statutory definition of a money transmission business under 18 USC 1960 or 31 USC 5330 were rejected by DC District Court Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. Jackson found that relying on a favorable interpretation of the statutory language was not an effective defense. After moving to dismiss the charges, it was denied, punishable by long prison time and heavy fines. Douglas Jackson and his co-defendants agreed to plea bargains. Jackson was sentenced to 36 months (supervised release), including 6 months of house arrest and electronic monitoring, and 300 hours of community service. He was also forced to hand over about $1.2 million to the government. His company was fined $300,000. The FBI did not seize the gold warehouse (which was in London), but even the most innocent account holders were left without access to their gold.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-bold">The justice department gave Jackson the opportunity to reopen the E-Gold and G&SR companies.</p>

In December 2010 Jackson announced on the E-Gold blog the approval of a plan to release frozen account balances, which would require account holders to complete an agreed-upon customer identification process. Later in an interview in 2012, Jackson said he was closing E-Gold and G&SR.</p>

					<h4>&DoubleRightArrow; <b>Bit Gold</b>, Decentralized Digital Currency Mechanism Design.</h4>
					<div class="lead text-justify">
						<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bit gold was one of the earliest attempts to create a decentralized virtual currency, proposed by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in 1998. Although the bit gold project was never implemented, Szabo's efforts were widely considered to be the predecessor to Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin protocol. Bit gold combines various cryptographic and mining elements to achieve decentralization, including time-stamped blocks stored in a title registry and generated using proof-of-work (PoW) strings.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the BitGold structure users have to solve cryptographic puzzles using computing power. It is then sent over the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) peer-to-peer network and then assigned to the puzzle solver's public key. Each solution then becomes part of the next challenge and creates an ever-evolving chain of new properties, thereby validating blocks of transactions and stamping new coins. This is similar to the block generation process in bitcoin, where the hash address is used as a header pointing to the next set of blocks.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Szabo said he created a small amount of gold to address some inefficiencies in the traditional financial system. According to Szabo, parties have to invest a lot of trust for transactions to occur in the traditional financial system. Unfortunately, transacting through trust-based systems leaves consumers and financial institutions vulnerable to fraud or theft. When trying to design transactions with digital coins, you run into the “double spend problem.” Once the data is created, reproducing it is a simple matter of copying and pasting. Most digital currencies solve the problem by relinquishing some control to a central authority, which tracks the balance of each account. This is an unacceptable solution for Szabo.</p>

						<p style="text-indent: 30px;">B-money was an initial proposal made by Wei Dai for an "anonymous distributed electronic cash system". Satoshi Nakamoto referenced b-money when creating Bitcoin. At that time some people thought that Wei Dai was one of the Bitcoin developers and asked him several things about Bitcoin, then he replied:</p>

                                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In his essay, published on the cypherpunks mailing list in November 1998, Dai proposed two protocols. The first protocol is impractical because it requires a broadcast channel that cannot be jammed and is also synchronous.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1. First protocol,</span><br>
                                The use of the proof-of-work function is proposed as a means to make money. B-Money Dai was proposed in the context of a cypherpunks mailing list discussion relating to possible applications of Hashcash, the first symmetric proof-of-work function, which was also published on the same mailing list, the previous year - May 1997. (Like the B-money proposal, bitcoin itself was also uses hashcash fee function as proof-of-work during coin minting). In B-Money, money is transferred by broadcasting transactions to all participants, all of whom hold everyone else's accounts. Contracts may be made with the possibility of reparation in the event of default, with a third party agreeing to be the arbitrator. If there is no agreement, each party broadcasts arguments or evidence in its favor and each participant determines compensation/fines in his own account.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2. Second protocol,</span><br>
                                <span>The second protocol has only a subset of participants ("servers") keeping accounts, which they must make public, and participants making transactions verify their balances by querying many of them. The participants also verified that the money supply was not inflated. A certain amount of money as collateral is required to be a lost server if the server is found to be dishonest.</span>
                                </p>
                                An alternative method for earning money is proposed, through an auction in which participants bid on the solution of a computing problem of known complexity.

The domain is registered at anonymousspeech.com, a site that allows users to register domain names anonymously. Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by two of Bitcoin's first developers, Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi. When Nakamoto left the project, he gave access rights to ownership of the domain to several people, but separate from the Bitcoin developers, to divide roles and responsibilities to prevent unilateral control by someone or a certain group of the Bitcoin project.</p>

On January 9, 2009, Bitcoin software version 0.1 was released. Compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows, it lacks a command line interface and is so complete that it has led to speculation that it was developed by more than one person (or by an academic with little programming experience and a lot of theoretical knowledge). Three days later the first transaction of Bitcoin currency, at block 170, occurred between Satoshi and Hal Finney. This is what led Finney to talk that he might have been a ghostwriter on behalf of Nakamoto.</p>

In 2010 the first exchange was born, it was founded by dwdollar as a Bitcoin currency exchange. In May of the same year, the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin occurred when a Jacksonville, Florida programmer, Laszlo Hanyecz, offered to pay 10000 Bitcoins for a pizza on the Bitcoin Forum. At that time, exchange rates put the purchase price of a pizza at around US$25.</p>

                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be sent online via the internet. Bitcoins are sent directly from one person to another via a peer-to-peer network. Unlike conventional fiat currencies, bitcoin is different in that there is no oversight that can control the value, transactions do not go through a third party and this makes costs much lower, people can use it in any country around the world, there will be no account freezes and there are no arbitrary requirements or limitations.</p>
                         <p class="lead font-weight-bold">How does Bitcoin work :</p>
                         <ul class="container lead">
                             <li>Currency exchanges exist where you can buy and sell Bitcoin for Fiat Currency</li>
                             <li>Bitcoins are stored in a Digital Wallet on a Computer or Mobile Device</li>
                             <li>Sending Bitcoin is as easy as sending an E-mail</li>
                             <li>The Bitcoin network is protected by individuals called Miners</li>
                             <li>Miners are rewarded with newly generated Bitcoins for verifying transactions</li>
                             <li>All verified transactions will be recorded in a transparent public file</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Transfers are facilitated directly without using a financial processor between nodes. This type of transaction makes chargebacks impossible. The Bitcoin client will broadcast the transaction to nearby nodes which will spread the payment across the network. Failed or incorrect transactions will be rejected by honest clients. Transactions are mostly free of charge, but a fee may usually be paid to other nodes to prioritize transaction processing.</p>
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Total circulation will eventually be 21 million bitcoins. There will never be more coins than that. Coins enter circulation gradually, at a steady rate over the years, to nodes supporting the network in proportion to the CPU time they contribute, it is estimated that by 2013 half of the total circulation will be successfully generated, and by 2017, 3/4 of it will be finished generating. As Bitcoin continues its journey to value, it will likely begin to experience deflation, with nodes in this period expected to rely on their ability to competitively collect transaction processing fees.</p>
                         <blockquote class="container blockquote">
                             <p class="lead mb-0">“<span style="font-style: italic;">So basically, it's like a "collector's item", not currency. A very scary "resource", if you can call it that. You get 50 BTC after a few months, which means that you've basically just spent $50 on electricity to get your "free" money.

                                 After all, these virtual "currencies" are bad for many reasons, not even funny. Firstly, the purpose of currency is not to hoard - it is to be spent on goods/services. Currency is an IOU note <sup title="Maybe?, Need a reference !">(I owe you)</sup> that devalues over time. It's not a hard asset, like coal or copper or MegaAssInc stock. FIAT currencies tend to be *backed* by something, like an economy, like the United States or the European Union or even China. What is this supported by?</span>”</p>

					<h4>&DoubleRightArrow; <b>Altcoin</b>, Cryptocurrency After Bitcoin</h4>
<div class="text-justify">
<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies launched after the success of Bitcoin. Most altcoins try to target Bitcoin's perceived shortcomings and generate competitive advantages in newer versions. Many new types of currency have been very profitable and also risky in recent years. The initial distribution of these coins was carried out in various ways, for example Airdrop and Pre-sale. In the world of Crypto Currency, the total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization has exceeded 2 Trillion USD, exactly on May 12 2021 is the highest peak to date.</p>
                         <div class="text-center">
                             <img class="container img-thumbnail border border-dark" src="/" alt="Total Market Capitalization">
                             <p>Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (Excluding Bitcoin).<br>Reached its highest value on May 12, 2021.<br>Source <a class="text-dark font-weight-bold" href="https:/ /bit.ly/3DDhEB3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a></p>

                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;"> The term "Altcoin" is a combination of two words: "alt" and "coin" where alt means "alternative" and coin means "cryptocurrency". Together they imply the category of cryptocurrency, which is an alternative to the digital currency Bitcoin. After Bitcoin's success story, many other peer-to-peer digital currencies have emerged to try to replicate that success. Many altcoins are built on the basic structure provided by Bitcoin. Therefore, most altcoins are peer-to-peer, requiring a mining process where users solve the difficult problem of solving blocks and providing a safe and cheap way to conduct transactions online. But Altcoins, even with many overlapping features, vary greatly from each other.</p>
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Some people like Carlie Lee, who is a software engineer who worked at Google and Coinbase. In October 2011, he released his version of bitcoin, which he dubbed litecoin. This changed several features of bitcoin, resulting in a network with faster transaction completion times and lower fees. He will often characterize it as the silver to bitcoin's gold.</p>
                         <div class="lead">
                             <p class="font-weight-bold">Bitcoin price developments are expected to impact Altcoin prices for at least three reasons.</p>
                             <ul class="container">
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Bitcoin dominates the virtual currency market,</span> compared to Altcoins, in many occasions it can be expected to become the preferred medium of exchange for goods and services for businesses and consumers. Likewise, due to its dominant market position, Bitcoin may also often be the investment asset of choice for potential investors</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">The strong dominance of Bitcoin,</span> as a medium of exchange in Altcoin sales transactions (composition of trading currencies) indicates a further source of dependence between Bitcoin and Altcoin Prices</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Price Development,</span> Bitcoin and Altcoin markets show some similarities in price development (similarities in price development)</li>
                             </ul>
                         </div>
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Although, the size of the altcoin market has increased significantly over the past few years, both in relative and absolute terms, altcoins have a rather small but increasing share in total market capitalization virtual currency. Ethereum is the altcoin with the largest market share at the moment. An important determinant of any currency price is its supply in the short, medium and long term. Virtual currencies also regulate the money supply by controlling the stock of money in circulation and its growth rate. However, neither the stock nor the growth rate of money is controlled by a centralized financial authority or government, but by the financial mathematical algorithms themselves. Many virtual currencies have followed Bitcoin and have a fixed (maximum) limit on the total supply of coins that can be circulated (minted), for example Ripple, LiteCoin and Dash.</p>
						

                         <p class="lead font-weight-bold">Types of Altcoins :</p>
                         <div class="form-group lead">
                             <ul class="container">
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Mining-Based,</span> Most mining-based altcoins use Proof-of-Work (PoW), a method in which a system generates new coins by solving a difficult problem , to create blocks. Examples of mining-based Altcoins are Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash.</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Stablecoins,</span> Cryptocurrency trading and use has been characterized by volatility since its launch. Stablecoins aim to reduce this overall volatility by grouping their value into a basket of goods, such as fiat currency, precious metals, or other cryptocurrencies. Examples of Stablecoins are USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, DAI and HUSD.</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Security Tokens,</span> Security tokens are similar to securities traded on stock markets except they have a digital provenance. Security tokens resemble traditional shares and often promise equity, in the form of ownership, or dividend payments to their holders. Security tokens are generally offered to investors through initial coin offerings (ICOs).</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Meme Coins,</span> Meme coins are inspired by jokes or silly views on other well-known cryptocurrencies. They usually gain popularity in a short period of time, often hyped online by prominent crypto influencers and retail investors trying to exploit short-term gains. For example, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) and cryptocurrency enthusiast Elon Musk regularly posts cryptic tweets about leading meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu often substantially changing their prices.</li>
                                 <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Utility Tokens</span> Utility tokens are used to provide services in the network. For example, they may be used to purchase services, pay network fees, or redeem rewards. Filecoin, which is used to purchase storage space on the network, is an example of a utility token.</li>
                             </ul>
                         </div>
                         <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">To this day, cryptocurrencies continue to go in a direction that is more fascinating and strange than now. All kinds of reasons are given to be able to market coins throughout the world. This can sometimes make us happy, sad or even crazy to think about. We hope that this progress can be utilized as well as possible in technological, economic and other developments.</p>
