                        <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">This is the easiest way to get crypto. You can buy it in certain Apps from the web as well as by mobile. There are many ways to buy cryptocurrency including:</p>
                        <ul class="container lead">
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Trading,</span> is a place to trade. You need to know, each trading application has its own rules, such as minimum deposits, deposit lines and countries verified by the application. For Indonesia, the author recommends that you buy crypto on the Indodax, Rekeningku and Tokocrypto applications. However, you are required to verify the user to be able to use the application. You don't need to worry, usually this process will be accepted quickly as long as the registration is good and correct.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Visa/Credit Card,</span> not a few users use credit cards. Some applications provide this without having to do KYC (Know Your Customers) on an application. You just have to register and make a deposit with a credit card.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div id="section2">
                    <h4 id="section1">&DoubleRightArrow; Exchange</h4>
                    <div class="lead text-justify">
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">This is usually done by someone who really understands the use of crypto. Exchange is carried out when you have several assets in the form of crypto tokens (not coins). Exchanges can be made if your coin type has the ability to use dApp/DeFi. Such as ETH ERC20, BNB BEP-20, TRX TRC10 and TRC20 and many more.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div id="section3">
                    <h4 id="section1">&DoubleRightArrow; Airdrop</h4>
                    <div class="text-justify">
                        <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Airdrop is an activity where several companies, applications or platforms create new types of coins/tokens to distribute them for free with certain conditions. Such as following social media accounts, creating blog posts, voting and so on. Usually these distributions have a limit of verified people on their list to win the Airdrop. This is done so that these crypto coins spread globally to lure crypto users to buy and hold their coins to make the coins valuable and have great value. Usually this can be found on Websites, Telegram, Twitter, Voter agents and Discord</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div id="section4">
                    <h4 id="section1">&DoubleRightArrow; Giveaway</h4>
                    <div class="text-justify">
                        <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Giveaways are not much different from Airdrops, but Giveaway creators often create events with bigger prizes with fewer winnings and are also only temporary. Although some media such as Instagram and Twitter do this almost every day and sometimes this is done to fraudulently increase the number of likes of a post or content and also followers.</p>

                    <div class="text-justify">
                        <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">This is the easiest way. You are only active in certain communities and you will be paid for your activity as a member of that community. This cannot be found publicly, so you initially have to work hard to continuously analyze crypto activity online. Usually you can find this on various social media that exist or are currently booming.</p>

                    <div class="lead text-justify">
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">You can also get crypto by doing online tasks by certain parties, sometimes an application thatCrypto-based Bounty missions with enough prizes to fill your wallet for a whole month. If you often hear about freelancers, you can search the Internet and find several companies/websites that can pay you in crypto. It's pretty easy and fun to earn crypto while doing the work you do.</p>

                    <h4 id="section1">&DoubleRightArrow; Mining</h4>
                    <div class="lead text-justify">
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Mining is the easiest way for beginners and also those who are professionals in crypto. You can mine using only the CPU/GPU performance of your current computer (as long as your specifications are capable of generating sufficient Hashrate). Some companies provide rental machines for mining and you can sit back and relax while watching your coins mined (as long as the price doesn't drop). Some websites also provide free crypto mining just by registering an account and also some by playing games.</p>
