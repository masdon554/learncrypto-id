In the case of decentralized cryptocurrencies, companies or governments cannot control these systems. The technical system underlying decentralized cryptocurrencies was created by a group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto. In proof-of-work cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, the security, integrity, and balance of the ledger are managed by a community of mutually distrusting parties known as Miners. The miners' job is to help validate and time-record transactions, adding them to the ledger according to a specific timestamp scheme. Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually reduce production of that currency, placing a limit on the total amount of the currency that will ever circulate, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Blockchain is an ever-growing list of digital data records. The blockchain is used to verify the permanence of Bitcoin transactions and to prevent double-spending. The first prototype of blockchain dates back to the early 1990s when computer scientist Stuart Haber and physicist W. Scott Stornetta implemented cryptographic techniques in blockchain as a way to secure digital documents from data tampering. This inspired many computer scientists and other cryptography enthusiasts, which ultimately led to the creation of Bitcoin, as the first decentralized electronic cash system and also the first Cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin whitepaper was published in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Blockchain transactions occur in a peer-to-peer network of globally distributed computers (nodes). Each node stores a copy of the blockchain and contributes to the function and security of the network. This is what makes Bitcoin a decentralized digital currency that is borderless, censorship-resistant, and requires no third-party intermediaries.</p>

So the Bitcoin network consists of thousands of computer nodes spread across the world, and this is what makes Bitcoin a peer-to-peer distributed economic system. Each blockchain node is a communication point in the network. There are different types of nodes, and each type is responsible for performing a different set of functions.</p>

This is a solution implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto in adjusting the transaction sequence to prevent double-spending in Bitcoin transactions. Timestamps prove that the data existed at that time, unambiguously, so that it can be included in the hash. Each timestamp encloses the previous timestamp in a hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp emphasizing the previous timestamp.</p>

Miners are tasked with maintaining the integrity of the network and are also responsible for introducing new coins into the system.</p>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 30px;">Unlike a banking system that prints and distributes fiat currency controlled by a central government authority, the issuance of new coins in cryptocurrency is not in the hands of a centralized entity. New coin units are generated through the mining process, which follows a set of rules set by the underlying protocol and is governed by a consensus algorithm. The miners' job is to collect unconfirmed transactions from the memory pool and organize them into candidate blocks that they will try to validate.</p>

                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Coin Creation,</span> When creating a candidate block, miners include a transaction in which they send a block reward to themselves. These transactions are known as coinbase transactions and are often the first recorded in a block.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Coin Formation Confirmation,</span> before confirmation, each transaction is hashed, and the output is organized into pairs. These pairs are then hashed, producing a new output that is also organized into pairs and hashed once again. This process is repeated until a single hash is produced, which is called the root hash or Merkle tree root.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Hash Block,</span> The root hash is then combined with the hash of the previously confirmed block, along with a pseudo-random number called the nonce. These elements are then hashed, producing a block hash for that candidate block.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Block Validation,</span> miners will only be successful if the resulting output (block hash) for their candidate block is below a predetermined value (target). This results in repeating the same process until a valid result is found. The first miner to find a valid hash validates their candidate block and gets a block reward. The whole process takes an average of ten minutes.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Validation Verified,</span> Once a block is validated, it is added to the blockchain and miners start working on the next block. The valid hash generated by miners serves as proof of their work and this is why Bitcoin's consensus algorithm is called Proof of Work. Each confirmed block has a unique block hash that acts as an identifier. The block reward is determined by the Bitcoin protocol and decreases every 210,000 blocks (approximately four years).</li>

They are required when sending and receiving Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Digital wallets are programmed with 2 keys, namely, the Public Key, used to generate the wallet address, which is required to receive payments and the Private Key, on the other hand, used during digital signature creation and transaction verification (private key). is confidential and may not be shared with anyone). </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Unlike traditional wallets that we use in everyday life, crypto wallets don't actually store your funds. In fact, your coins (or tokens) are just part of the blockchain system as a piece of data, and the wallet serves as a means of accessing them.</p>
